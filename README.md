Project title: Scratch vs Thanos

Scratch vs Thanos is an educational and entertaining C++ game where learning meets adventure. The player, as Scratch, must answer 5 programming questions—each representing an Infinity Stone. Every correct answer pushes Thanos back and unlocks a stone, while the background changes to reflect progress: sunny ➝ sunset ➝ night. A wrong answer ends the game, challenging the player to try again.

This project helps beginners strengthen their programming logic through interactive gameplay, encouraging critical thinking and making coding fun and engaging.
